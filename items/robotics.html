            <h2>FIRST Robotics Captain & Mentor</h2>

            <h2>FIRST Robotics Competition Overview</h2>
            <p>FIRST Robotics is a K-12 program where students learn engineering, technology, and teamwork skills through robotics. First Robotics Competition (FRC) is the highest level in FIRST where the participants are high school students.</p>
            <p>Every year there is a new game (accompanied by a 100+ page rule book, a fun read) released at the same time globally. Teams then have six weeks to design, build, and test their robot. In FRC, teams build metal bots weighing around 140 lbs.</p>
            <p>At the end of the build period, teams will attend regionals where they will be put on "alliances" of three robots to compete against another set of three robots. There are a number of qualification matches which consist of random alliances each time. At the end of qualifications, there are elimination matches where the top eight teams from qualifications get to choose their alliance.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>I was on <a href="https://mmr2410.squarespace.com/">FRC team 2410</a> for the 2017 and 2018 seasons. I joined the team after learning about it through my engineering program in high school as a chance to build technical knowledge and explore my interest in engineering.</p>
            <p>My roles both on the team and as a mentor:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>In 2017, I began my first season on the team. I became highly involved on the team and developed a particular interest in the electrical portions of the robot. With the loving guidance of mentors, I took on the role as the electrical lead for my first season. My tasks included sensor selection, troubleshooting, integration with software, wiring the bot, and educating other team members about the robot electronics. This experience is what led me to ultimately choose Electrical & Computer Engineering as my degree.</li>
              <li>In 2018, I was selected to be the captain of the 55 person team. I was in charge of <b>coordinating and managing the whole team including the technical build (electrical, programming, mechanical), sponsorships, public relations / outreach, and driving strategy.</b> Under my leadership with the support of many talented prospective engineering students, we ranked number one at the Iowa Regional out of 61 robots.</li>
              <li>In 2020, I supported the team remotely as they made the difficult transition a virtual model due to the COVID-19 lockdown. I provided technical mentorship as well as perspective on selecting solutions to ease coordination and communication remotely.</li>
              <li>Post graduation, I have returned as an in person mentor. I primarily work with the electrical and programming portions of the team. <b>I provide mentorship on troubleshooting techniques, programming architecture, sensor selection, vision development, rapid prototyping, and motor control.</b> I also always just try to provide whatever input helps the students to find their passions within STEM! This has included providing education on <b>fundamental electrical engineering concepts, perspective on education/career opportunities, Linux tips and tricks, basic machining, and more.</b></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Robots in Action!</h2>
            <p>Below are some fun photos of both of the robots I personally worked on in action!</p>
            <p>Both robots use what is called a "swerve" drive. Swerve is a drive train where you have a wheel at all four corners that can turn 360 degrees and drive the robot. There are two motors on each wheel: one for driving the wheel and one for rotating the wheel's orientation. Since each wheel is independent from one another, it is essential to have a calibrated system that uses accurate encoders to track wheel positions. It is a notably tricky drivetrain to develop, and I am proud that we were able to implement this for the first time in our team's history!</p>
            <p>I worked closely with the programmers and mentors to select encoders that were compatible with our drive train and provided the necessary precision and accuracy. We went through three different encoder types before finding one that met all our needs that also provided the necessary reliability to make it through competition</p>
