    "name": "Wax Melter",
    "description": "I designed and programmed a board to heat wax (used in candle making) to a specified temperature based on user input. I came up with the problem statement, wrote the proposal,  designed the schematic, layed out the PCB, wrote the C code, tested, and refined the system. <br><br>This project was chosen because I run a candle business and wanted to optimize my workflow. The system is controllable via an OLED with buttons interface and a self hosted web interface. This dual UI approach allows monitoring next to the unit or more remotely.<br><br>The board heats the wax via a hot plate it controls via flipping a relay outlet. The wax itself is in a double broiler ontop of the hot plate.",

    "name": "Attractnid",
    "description": "Attractnid is a four legged robot which can scale metal surfaces. It relies on magnets to attach itself to surfaces. The robot uses feet with permanent magnetics to attach to surfaces. Servos on the top of the feet rotate a permanent magnet to cancel the magnetic fields to detach the leg, allowing another set of servos to rotate the legs. An accelerometer keeps track of the orientation of the robot, allowing the robot to move along any specified angle.<br><br>My key contributions to the team was software development, firmware development, and building the project website.",

    "name": "Vision Stand Calibration",
    "description": "I developed software to calibrate the Vision Test Stands at the JDES (John Deere Electronic Solutions) plant. These testers verify the functionality of displays made for use in John Deere tractors and construction equipement. The calibration code I wrote will reduce the number of engineering hours to develop tests and reduce false failures on the manufacturing line. <br><br> I brought this problem from concept to finish. I packaged my finished software into reusable portions that allow other engineers to easily implement the calibration files into their own code. I also wroote a thorough document explaining not only the calibration files but how the vision testers work, as many engineers are less familiar with this technology.",

These zines are aimed at high school students with an algebra understanding. They are meant to get students excited about math by giving purpose to the things they are learning.  <br><br>I created the zine format, wrote about the basics of Linear Algebra (Matrices, Vectors, Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors), explained how SVD works on an image, and developed the code examples (MATLAB, Python, and WolframAlpha).",
